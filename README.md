## Contribution

This is just a university project for one of my modules. Feel free to take parts and use them to assist in your work (but don't get caught plagiarizing, don't be a fool).

If you want to tell me how something could have been done better or if I’ve committed some cardinal sin, my contact details are on my profile. I probably won’t update this, but I’ll appreciate the lesson.
